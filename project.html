    <p>
       This project is part of the dissemination objectives for the Master's thesis in Digital and Public Humanities at Ca' Foscari University of Venice, titled "Analysing and Reaccessing Texts through Character Interaction Network: The Interpoetic Narrative of Spoon River Anthology," written by Mattia Moscato.

This study employs Character Network Analysis (CNA) to examine Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology, a distinctive collection of interconnected poems. It addresses the limited application of CNA to unconventional literary works by evaluating its effectiveness in this context. The research focuses on how character interactions construct an interpoetic narrative within the anthology. By integrating manual data extraction, network visualisation, and sentiment analysis, the study maps and interprets these interactions. Findings reveal a central connected component with key characters arranged in "Hub-and-Spoke" structures that drive the narrative. The analysis also considers the impact of supplementary poems from the 1916 edition, demonstrating that these additions reinforce but do not significantly alter the existing narrative. Furthermore, the study highlights how poems often express negative sentiments towards those poems/characters inspired by real Lewistown residents, reflecting Masters' critical view of his hometown. By employing CNA, the research provides a novel approach for re-accessing and re-evaluating the text, showcasing CNAâ€™s potential in literary analysis. The findings suggest that CNA could be a valuable tool for future research in digital humanities, advocating for the creation of a comprehensive digital edition to enhance accessibility and engagement with the text.  </p>

    The purpose of the website is to create a portal that, first and foremost, makes available the datasets used on a GitHub repository, along with instructions for uploading them to a directed graph in Network X and conducting investigations using the methodologies described in the thesis or following one's own interests. The homepage features a directed network of mention interactions among the characters in Spoon River Anthology, obtained through dynamic visualization with Pyvis, which also includes a search bar for poems within the network.
